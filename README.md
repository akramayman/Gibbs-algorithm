# Gibbs-algorithm

## Motif finding By Gibbs sampling algorithm.

The idea is to creat gibbs algorithm using c++ language to find the motife in small fragment of nucleotide,where the motife is a sequence motif is set of  nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern that is widespread and has, or is conjectured to have, a biological significance. that are important for protein function and are located within a certain distance from each other.

and Gibbs sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for obtaining a sequence of observations which are approximately from a specified multivariate probability distribution, when direct sampling is difficult. 

## Requirements to run the code:
### 1) choose sequences with length 10 nucleotides.
### 2) choose random initial position of motif
